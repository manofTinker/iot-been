    <!-- mirrors
     | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
     |
     | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
     | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
     | it to several places.
     |
     | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
     | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
     | server for that repository.

    <!-- profiles
     | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
     | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
     | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
     |
     | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
     | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
     | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
     |
     | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
     | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
     | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,
     | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
     | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
     | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
     |
     | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
     |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
     |       variables for plugins in the POM.
